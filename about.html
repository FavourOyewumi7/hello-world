     <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a young boy, born in the year 2000, which makes me 18 years old. 
        I studied at Jolibuks Children school for my primary education, and completed my secondary education
        at the prestigious International School, University of Lagos, and now completing my B.Sc in Applied Physics[Electronics]
        at the University of First choice [University of Lagos].
        I started my Web Journey in the year 2016,  its been slow but I have been making a lot of progress,
        I digressed for a while to go into Artificial Intelligence, I have gone a little distance but surely I have still have a lot more ground to cover
        I hope to be able to use my knowledge to make a difference in my immediate community and even the world. 
        Oh yeah!, i forgot, I am also a photographer that loves taking beautiful pictures.
